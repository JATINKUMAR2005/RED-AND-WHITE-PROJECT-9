# Sales Analysis and Visualization

## üìå Project Overview
This project performs sales data analysis and visualization using the dataset `sales_data.csv`. The objective is to understand performance across products, regions, and time, and derive insights from sales and profit trends.

The notebook `PROJECT 9.ipynb` contains all steps from data import to analysis and visualization.

## üìÇ Dataset Information (`sales_data.csv`)

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Date     | The date of the sale (YYYY-MM-DD format) |
| Product  | The product name sold |
| Sales    | Sales amount for the transaction |
| Region   | The geographic region of the sale |
| Profit   | Profit generated from the sale |
| Year     | The year of the sale extracted from the Date |
| Month    | The month of the sale extracted from the Date |

The dataset is used for time-based, product-based, and region-based analysis.
